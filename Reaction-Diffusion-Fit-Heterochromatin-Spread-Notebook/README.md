# ðŸ§¬ Reactionâ€“Diffusion Modeling of H3K9me2 Spreading in *S. pombe*

This repository implements a biologically motivated reactionâ€“diffusion model to study the spatial propagation of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast). The model quantitatively tests how nucleation sites, feedback-driven spreading, and turnover dynamics shape the steady-state methylation landscape, especially in wild-type (WT) and *leo1*Î” mutant backgrounds.

## ðŸ§ª **Biological context**

- **H3K9me2** is a hallmark of heterochromatin, restricting gene expression in specific genomic regions.
- In *leo1*Î” mutants, impaired turnover of H3K9me2 leads to ectopic spreading into normally euchromatic domains.
- We integrate:
  - ChIP-seq data from Sadeghi et al. (2015): genome-wide H3K9me2 profiles.
  - Hi-C data from Mizuguchi et al. (2014): 3D chromatin globules that act as boundaries.

This computational framework models how local nucleation, readerâ€“writer feedback, and turnover jointly explain observed methylation patterns.

## âš™ **Model overview**

We simulate the evolution of methylation density \( m(x,t) \) over genomic position \( x \) using the PDE:

dm/dt = D * dÂ²m/dxÂ² + Î±(x) + Î² * m^n / (K^n + m^n) - Î³ * m
Where:

- D : effective diffusion coefficient (spreading)
- Î±(x) : spatially localized nucleation sources (triangular peaks + baseline)
- Î², K, n : parameters of the feedback-driven Hill function
- Î³ : turnover rate, representing removal of H3K9me2

## ðŸ“Š **Data & parameters**

| Dataset | Genomic region modeled | Reference |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| ChIP-seq (WT and *leo1*Î”) | Chr II, 1.15â€“1.20 Mb | Sadeghi et al. (2015) |
| Hi-C globule | Chr II, 1.15â€“1.20 Mb | Mizuguchi et al. (2014) |

- Baseline nucleation rates and peak positions/strengths are extracted directly from ChIP-seq `.wig` files.
- See `peaks_info` in the code for precise peak locations and heights.
